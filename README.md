Persian: **نظریه معمای عصبی**

Python implementation of the Neural Puzzle Theory, a four-layer microtubule-mediated model showing how resting potential heterogeneity enables long-term memory storage.

## 📄 About The Paper

This code accompanies the paper:
> "Neural Puzzle Theory: Resting Potential Heterogeneity as the Physical Substrate of Long-Term Memory Storage"

The model proposes that memories are stored in the heterogeneous resting potentials of neurons, with each neuron acting as a puzzle piece.
